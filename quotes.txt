Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
So many code, so little time
I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 lines of shitty code
That glitch that doesn't kill us strengthens us
If you judge users, you have no time to love them
I'm not afraid of bugs; I just don't want to be there when it happens
The programming of too many useless things results in too many usefull devs
